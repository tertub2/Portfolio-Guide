# Python

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| ‚úã [Left Handed People and Deaths](https://github.com/katiehuangx/CS50P/blob/main/README.md) | Programming | Famous left-handed individuals like Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Babe Ruth, and Marie Curie have sparked curiosity about left-handedness and life expectancy. Contradicting a previous study suggesting left-handed people die nine years earlier, a 2005 study found only a slight association with increased risk of death. This notebook explores changing rates of left-handedness over time using age distribution data, using pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of age at death based on hand preference. The goal is to challenge the notion that left-handed individuals have a shorter lifespan. | Pandas, Matplotlib| 
| üì∫ [TMDb Movie Analysis](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%202%20-%20TMDB%20Movie%20Analysis.ipynb) |   Data Wrangling & EDA | I analysed more than 10,000 TMDb movies and getting the answers to - Which actor(s) is associated with higher revenue and profit, Does a higher budget constitute to a higher profit, and Which director produced the highest grossing movie? | pandas, matplotlib |   
| ‚õΩÔ∏è [Fuel Economy](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Case%20Study%202%20-%20Fuel%20Economy.ipynb) | Data Wrangling & EDA | Analysis on vehicles‚Äô fuel economy in 2008 and 2018 to understand usage of alternative sources of fuel, changes in greenhouse gas and smog ratings over the decade, and vehicle features associated with better fuel economy. |  pandas, matplotlib |   
| üç∑ [Wine Quality](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Case%20Study%201%20-%20Analysing%20Wine%20Quality.ipynb) | Data Wrangling & EDA | A study on red and white wine samples and understanding whether certain types of wine and their qualities (alcohol level, sugar content and acidity level) are associated with higher wine quality. | pandas, matplotlib |   
| üå§ [Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Udacity-Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/blob/main/Project%201%20-%20Explore%20Weather%20Trends.ipynb) | Time-series analysis | In this time-series analysis, I use moving average method to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where I live to overall global temperature trends. | pandas, matplotlib |
| üõç [Super Store Analysis](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Super-Store-Analysis/blob/main/Super_Store_Analysis.ipynb) | EDA | Analysis of sales data to find out highest revenue and profit product categories and top customer segments. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |
| üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [Bellabeat Fitness Tracking Analysis](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone/blob/main/bellabeat-data-analysis.ipynb) | EDA | Discovered insights into whether users are using the FitBit app for tracking health habits, their frequency of usage across the week and whether there is correlation between the hours logged, number of steps taken and calories burnt. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn |

# Power BI

| Project Link | Project Description | Dashboard Link |
|---|---|---|
| ü§ì [ENEM Challenge V.1](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Maven-Unicorn-Challenge) | I tackled the comprehensive analysis of ENEM 2020 data, covering everything from Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to impactful data visualizations using Power BI. Through this challenge, I gained valuable insights into student performance, demographic trends, and educational disparities, empowering decision-makers to enhance educational strategies and opportunities. | [Dashboard](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1tL3c-TI7jnJbXgjPr3o9DllFtkxckiYA) |
| ü§ìüîÇ [ENEM Challenge V.2](https://medium.com/@tertuliano.f.m/enem-microdata-project-a8946e14517d) | I created a new version of the ENEM Project, using Power BI for the visualization and KNIME for ETL, enabling more in-depth analyses of the ENEM 2020 registered students. I specifically focused on socio-economic analyses, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the data and providing valuable insights to drive impactful decisions in the educational domain. | [Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTVhN2E0YjEtOGNkZS00MjZmLTgyNmUtZmJhNDA2YTUyNGZhIiwidCI6IjdlMzNhODk5LWZjZDEtNGU1MS04YTczLTQ2NTA0ODFjMjJjMiJ9) |
