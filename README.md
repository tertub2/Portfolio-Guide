# Python

| Project Link | Area | Project Description | Libraries |    
|---|---|---|---|
| ‚úã [Left Handed People and Deaths](https://github.com/tertub2/Left-Handed-Project/blob/main/Do%20Left-handed%20People%20Really%20Die%20Young_/notebook.ipynb) | Data Wrangling & EDA | Famous left-handed individuals like Barack Obama, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Babe Ruth, and Marie Curie have sparked curiosity about left-handedness and life expectancy. Contradicting a previous study suggesting left-handed people die nine years earlier, a 2005 study found only a slight association with increased risk of death. This notebook explores changing rates of left-handedness over time using age distribution data, using pandas and Bayesian statistics to analyze the probability of age at death based on hand preference. The goal is to challenge the notion that left-handed individuals have a shorter lifespan. | Pandas, Matplotlib| 
| üì∫ [Netflix Movies Analysis](https://github.com/tertub2/Netflix-Project)|   Data Wrangling & EDA | Netflix, the once DVD rental service founded in 1997, has evolved into the entertainment industry's giant, now boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021 (CBS, 2021). With a vast library of movies and series, this dataset offers an exciting opportunity to explore the world of entertainment. Specifically, the dataset includes movies and series data from 1940 to 2020, with a focus on average movie durations from 2011 to 2020, which ranged from 90 to 103 minutes. This analysis allows us to dive into Netflix's dynamic evolution and gain valuable insights into the entertainment trends over the years. | Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| üë∂ [US Names](https://github.com/tertub2/US-Names-Project/blob/main/README.md) |   Data Wrangling & EDA | I delved into the world of unique baby names using open data from the United States Social Security Administration (SSA). Analyzing popular names from 1920 to 2020 with Jupyter Notebook and a PostgreSQL database, I explored trends, creativity, and cultural significance behind naming traditions, offering valuable insights for parents seeking distinctive name choices. | Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn |

# Power BI

| Project Link | Project Description | Dashboard Link |
|---|---|---|
| ü§ì [ENEM Challenge V.1](https://github.com/katiehuangx/Maven-Unicorn-Challenge) | I tackled the comprehensive analysis of ENEM 2020 data, covering everything from Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to impactful data visualizations using Power BI. Through this challenge, I gained valuable insights into student performance, demographic trends, and educational disparities, empowering decision-makers to enhance educational strategies and opportunities. | [Dashboard](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1tL3c-TI7jnJbXgjPr3o9DllFtkxckiYA) |
| ü§ìüîÇ [ENEM Challenge V.2](https://medium.com/@tertuliano.f.m/enem-microdata-project-a8946e14517d) | I created a new version of the ENEM Project, using Power BI for the visualization and KNIME for ETL, enabling more in-depth analyses of the ENEM 2020 registered students. I specifically focused on socio-economic analyses, gaining a comprehensive understanding of the data and providing valuable insights to drive impactful decisions in the educational domain. | [Dashboard](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiNTVhN2E0YjEtOGNkZS00MjZmLTgyNmUtZmJhNDA2YTUyNGZhIiwidCI6IjdlMzNhODk5LWZjZDEtNGU1MS04YTczLTQ2NTA0ODFjMjJjMiJ9) |
